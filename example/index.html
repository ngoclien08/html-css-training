    <ul>
        <li><code>width=device-width</code> tells the page to match the screen's width in device-independent pixels (DIP). This lets the page reflow content to match different screen sizes.</li>
        <li>DIP: a standard visual pixel unit (which can be made up of many physical pixels on a high-density screen)</li>
        <li>Because some browsers keep the page's width constant when rotating to landscape mode, and zoom to fill the screen instead of reflowing</li>
        <li><code>initial-scale=1</code> tells browsers to set a 1:1 relationship between CSS pixels and device-independent pixels regardless of device orientation, letting the page take advantage of the full landscape width.</li>
        <li>Caution:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>To ensure that older browsers can properly parse the attributes, use a comma to separate attributes: content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"</li>
            <li>In addition to <code>initial-scale</code>, the <code>minimum-scale</code>, <code>maximum-scale</code>, and <code>user-scalable</code> attributes are also available. They are not recommended because they can prevent the user from zooming the viewport, potentially causing accessibility issues.</li>
